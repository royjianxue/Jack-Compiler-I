# Nand to Tetris Compiler I


This project is part of the Nand to Tetris(https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, which involves building a computer from basic logic gates. The Nand to Tetris Compiler I is responsible for compiling high-level Jack programming language code into Hack assembly code.

## Overview

The Nand to Tetris Compiler I is implemented in Python and is designed to translate Jack code into [desinated language]. The compiler consists of modules for lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Features

- Lexical analysis for tokenizing Jack code
- Syntax analysis for parsing Jack code
- Semantic analysis for type checking and error handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/royjianxue/Jack-Compiler-I.git
    cd nand2tetris-compiler-I
    ```


## Usage


```bash
# Example command to run the compiler
[]./compiler input.jack -output.asm]
